* This week you will sign-up for free accounts on [GitHub](https://github.com), [Rpubs](https://rpubs.com), and [Shiny](http://www.shinyapps.io). 

* When you register for a free individual GitHub account, request a [student discount](https://education.github.com) to obtain a few private repositories as well as unlimited public repositories.  Please use something similar to **first_name_last_name** as your username when you register with GitHub.  For example, my username on GitHub is *alanarnholt*. If you have a popular name such as John Smith, you may need to provide some other distinquishing characteristic in your username.  Please use the same **username** for your accounts on Rpubs and Shiny. 

* Once you have a GitHub account, send an email to arnholtat@appstate.edu with a Subject line of **STT 2810 - GitHub Username** and tell me in the body of your email your first name, last name, and your GitHub username.  I will then manually add you as a team member to the repository in the STT2810-SP15 organization that has your name (**Last_name-First_name**).  This repository will be where you store all of your work for this course.  I will also change your repository to a private repository.

* This week you will install [Git](http://git-scm.com/downloads), [R](http://cran.r-project.org), [RStudio](http://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/), [zotero](https://www.zotero.org), and optionally [$LaTeX$](http://www.ctan.org/starter) on your personal computer.
